**Home Sales Analysis**
`This Python notebook provides an analysis of home sales data using PySpark, a powerful analytics engine for large-scale data processing. The dataset used in this analysis contains information about home sales, including attributes such as date, price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more.`

**Installation**
You can install PySpark using pip:


`!pip install pyspark`


**Set Up Environment**
`The notebook begins by importing necessary libraries and setting up the PySpark environment. It creates a SparkSession, which is the entry point to programming Spark with the Dataset and DataFrame API.`

**Data Loading**
`The dataset is read from an AWS S3 bucket into a PySpark DataFrame using the spark.read.csv() method. The CSV file contains home sales data with various attributes.`

**Data Exploration**
`After loading the data, a brief exploration is conducted to understand its structure. The first few rows and the schema of the DataFrame are printed to gain insights into the dataset.`

**Data Analysis**
**Several data analysis tasks are performed using Spark SQL queries:**

`Average Price for Four-Bedroom Houses: Calculates the average price for a four-bedroom house sold per year, rounded to two decimal places.`
`Average Price of Homes by Year Built: Determines the average price of homes for each year they were built, considering homes with three bedrooms and three bathrooms.`
`Average Price of Homes by Year Built and Attributes: Computes the average price of homes for each year they were built, considering homes with specific attributes such as three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet.`
`Average Price of Homes by View Rating: Calculates the average price of homes per "view" rating, rounded to two decimal places, for homes with an average price greater than or equal to $350,000. The query also orders the results by descending view rating.`

**Data Caching**
`The notebook demonstrates the performance impact of caching data using Spark's in-memory caching mechanism. It compares the runtime of a query with and without caching.`

**Parquet Data Format**
`The notebook also covers the use of the Parquet data format, which is a columnar storage file format that provides efficient data compression and encoding. It includes steps to partition data by the "date_built" field and create a temporary table for the Parquet data.`

**Conclusion**
`The notebook concludes with a summary of the analysis and the runtime comparison between different operations performed on the dataset. It also includes the steps to download the notebook for further reference or sharing.`
